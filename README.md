This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The function includes error handling for empty lists; however, this may not always be the ideal behavior.  A solution is provided that addresses this potential issue. The original code throws an exception when an empty list is passed.  The solution offers a more robust way to handle the case of empty input lists.
